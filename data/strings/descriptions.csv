PCSCMM,WEAPON,"Standard Cylon missile launcher, finds it's use on midline ships as well as their biggest war machines.",Assault,,
PCSCMS,WEAPON,"The smallest of the Cylon missile launchers, often used as a point defense or fighter screening missile. Low range, low damage but perfectly fine as a defensive measurement.",Point Defense,,

CPC,WEAPON,"An ancient superweapon that saw first combat during the times of the thousand yahren war as the main weapon system of the Hadse Basestars of the Cylon Empire. Destructive, massive and a long cooldown and charge up time makes this weapon hard to use for the careless operator.

CYLA,WEAPON,"A mid size autocannon, good rate of fire, good damage against both capital ships and fighters.",,,
bsg_gbasestar,SHIP,The Guardian basestar was constructed by the Cylons at the end of the first Cylon War and is a part of the evolution towards modern basestar design. The first Hybrid to be developed was integrated into the systems of this ship. Some models thought this design to be too outdated but it appears to be filling a hole in modern Cylon doctrine as it's a cheaper Basestar.,,,
bsg_cygnus,SHIP,"The Cygnus Gunstar was designed after the first war with the goal to streamline the Colonial cruiser doctrine and unify all aspects needed in smaller Colonial crafts with many lessons learned from the first war. This small, versatile and fast ship packs quiet a punch. Being able to do short ftl jumps it's the perfect ""in and out adventure"" craft. Excelling in short engagements utilizing both forward and backwards firing guns in combination with a deadly missile array. A small fighter complement and some PD guns are making this small ship a deadly enemy.",,,
bsg_mercury,SHIP,"The Mercury-class Battlestar, peak ship design developed after the first war, taking the Minerva-Class as a base and improving it in every aspect this Battlestar focuses on a huge forward firing array of heavy artillery combined with thick armor and an excellent fighter complement you better ready your FTLs when encountering one of these warships.",,,
bsg_hbasestar,SHIP,"The Hades Basestar or Basestar MKI is one ancient design developed by mankind before the first war. Now in Cylon hand those defensive weapons platforms acted as the main Cylon capital ship during the first war. While relativley immobile their large amount of Raiders are chasing every enemy in sight, entering the combat zone of this massive ship is not advised as many cylon machine guns are prepared to take on everything that comes close to the ship.",,,
bsg_basestar2,SHIP,"The Basestar MKII, some call it the Nemesis-class, is the culmination of post first war Cylon war doctrine. Focusing on a large array of Raiders and long range missiles with no other munitions or turrets on board. While this capital ship is not meant for close quarters combat, it excells at long range striking with it's missiles and Raiders.",,,
bsg_galactica,SHIP,"The Jupiter class Battlestars were laid down in the early days of the First Cylon War. There were originally twelve built, one representing each of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol. They were heavily engaged in the war, and only three of the original twelve survived to see the armistice signed, ending the war. After the war, the surviving Battlestars remained in service, supplemented by additional ships under construction during the war. The class was continually upgraded and modified over the years, and several were still in service until the Fall of the Twelve Colonies. ",,,

bsg_raptor,SHIP,The Raptor is a multi purpose craft mainly used as a personnel transport but also a capable bomber craft.,,,
bsg_valkyrie,SHIP,The Valkyrie was developed at the end of the first war and continiously used and upgraded afterwards as it's relativley cheap to produce and maintain. It is a smaller and very mobile ship with an exposed belly and a lot of missiles on top. Not as tanky as it's fellow Battlestars but still a capable support craft with limited carrier capabilities.,,,
bsg_vm1,SHIP,"The Colonies fighter during the old Thousand Yahren War, equipped with lasers, missiles and shielding.",,,
bsg_rm1_tos,SHIP,"The Cylons standard fighter during the old Thousand Yahren War, equipped with lasers, missiles and shielding.",,,
bsg_vm2,SHIP,"The Colonies main fighter during the first war and succsessor to the Viper MKI. Agile, good fire power and capable or carrying a small ordenance. The MKII still found use during the second Cylon war because of its older tech and thus being immune to most hacking attacks",,,
bsg_vm7,SHIP,The Viper MK7 is the successor of the MKII (and the MKIII but we ignore that monstrosity for now). Trading ordenance for another machine gun making it the perfect interceptor.,,,
bsg_erebus,SHIP,"The Erebus is the civilian variant of the Defender-class. It's still equipped with a fair amount of weapons but it's hull is too fragile to actually engage in heavy combat. It's a popular combat freighter and personnel transport, being able to defend itself to some degree the colonies decided to integrate it into the military.",,,
bsg_defender,SHIP,The Defender-class is the beefy militarised version of the Erebus-class. Trading storage space and crew room for heavy weapons and thick armor. Good addition to any fleet needing a smaller support craft for the heavy hitters.,,,
bsg_intruder,SHIP,"The Intruder developed during the first war, served as a counter against the smaller Colonial ships like the Adamant or even the Janus. While it has seen better days it's design was heavily upgraded and in a shiny new design with a hull mirroring the Basestar MKII and modern machine gun and missile weaponry. Eventhough it's now up to a more modern standard it's combat capabilities are fairly limited and thus more effective as a combat freighter or armed personnel transport.",,,
bsg_rm1,SHIP,"The Raider MKI, a relic of the old days and still being commanded by 3 old school Centurions. Upgraded weaponry transformed this fighter into a heavy bomber, two machine guns and missiles are making this old fighter an angst-inducing sight.",,,

bsg_revenant,SHIP,"The Revenant, what happens if you combine a stolen design of a Scorpion gunship and a Cylon ship designer? A medium sized gunship with heavy broadside machine guns!

bsg_hydra,SHIP,"The Hydra is a first war Cylon design, back then it was mainly used as a technical support ship with modern computing systems meant to assist it's allies. Nowadays it's kinda old and dated and thus being transformed into a Cylon tanker as it was needed after setting foot in the sector.",,,
bsg_cera,SHIP,"The Cerastes, once a first war gunship and now an repurposed troop transport. Stripped of most of it's weapons and armor to make room for troops, crew and other Cylon personnel. After the Cylons settled in the sector a new smaller troop transport was needed in order to keep raiding the Colonial and Hegemony stations without using tons of Basestars just to transport troops around.",,,
bsg_talon,SHIP,"The Talon once a carrier with fighter screening abilities during the first war now a repurposed freighter. After the Cylons settled in the sector they searched for a good and cheap freighter and decided to repurpose this old first war design, stripping it's weapons and fighter facilities to make room for containers filled with wares.",,,

bsg_hub,CUSTOM,"The Cylon Resurrection Hub is a space-borne facility that coordinates the resurrection process among all of the Cylon resurrection ships and downloading facilities, with what appears to be a substantial operational range between itself and the rest of the Cylon fleet. It was designed by the Final Five and now acts as the Cylon's space station with upgraded armaments and weaponry. ",,,
bsg_ragnar,CUSTOM,"A relic from the first war with the Cylons, acted as a mobile base of operations for the Colonials during the first conflict. In the 40 years between the wars this type of station was forgotten and one of it's more known types resided at Ragnar, providing the escaping colonists with fuel and ammo. It is now being used as the standard space station for the colonies.",,,
bsg_adamant,SHIP,"The Adamant is very much a ""jack of all trades"" vessel: housing a hanger for a squadron, a set of torpedo tubes for munitions, strong armour for its size and significant firepower to match. This allows the Adamant to fill a lot of roles and be useful in almost any battle.",,,
bsg_atlas,SHIP,"The Atlas carrier is the only way for Colonial Fleet to carry many squadrons in a single ship without the expense of a Battlestar. It is the least manouverable vessel in Colonial Fleet by a significant margin, and this combined with its limited and inaccurate weaponry make it of limited use as a battleship.",,,
bsg_berserk,SHIP,"The Berzerk class carrier is a fast and effective force multiplier. The carrier is not designed to survive prolonged engagements by itself. However, when supporting a battlestar or strike group, it can provide powerful complementary firepower and squadron support.",,,
bsg_heracles,SHIP,"The Heracles is an Imperial Wars-era gunship of Leonid descent. The ship possesses very little finesse, and where it isn't covered in layers of armor plating, it's lined with point defense turrets capable of sustaining high volume flak fields. Its spine is lined with heavy twin-barrel guns, and features a set of ""doorkickers"" for direct, head-to-head assaults.",,,
bsg_janus,SHIP,"The Janus heavy cruiser is an old Gemenese ship, made popular during the later stages of the imperial wars between Virgon and Leonis. Heavy armour plating provides it with enough staying power to remain relevant in modern warfare, although its older fire control systems are considered outdated compared to more modern cruisers.",,,

bsg_minotaur,SHIP,"The Minotaur warship is a testament to the pragmatic nature of the Aerilan people; you build a ship, give it plenty of armour, and fit every other spare inch with guns. It is a cost-effective fixture for fleet groups looking to bulk up their firepower.",,,
bsg_orion,SHIP,"The Orion class battlestar was first developed and deployed sometime before or during the First Cylon War. Also known as a ""Pocket Battlestar"" or ""Half-Pint,"" the class appears to be among the smaller ships in the Colonial Fleet, dwarfed even by the Valkyrie type. It may be the smallest battlestar class to see service.",,,
bsg_ranger,SHIP,"Originally a Picon specialist design, the Ranger class cruiser has more recently become popular throughout the Twelve Colonies. Its combination of long-range dominance and skirmish-range turret configuration makes it a highly effective all-rounder in any strike group.",,,
bsg_argos,SHIP,"The Argos contains an overwhelming array of hangars and missile tubes, but hosts little in the way of self-defense. The Argos' external hangars allow for similar wing capacity as other supercarriers, but are not as effective with squadron support and repairs.",,,
bsg_cerberus,SHIP,"A supercarrier by Colonial standards, the Cerberus is the mainstay of Cylon assault forces. With greater hangar capacity than any other warship, and hull plating to rival a battlestar, the Cerberus provides an imposing tactical presence on any battlefield.",,,
bsg_cratus,SHIP,"Introduced during the height of the First Cylon War, the Cratus Class Heavy Basestar became a scourge to the Colonial Fleet. The mere presence of a Cratus could turn the tide of a battle in the Cylons' favor. Colonial Fleets would often have to combine Battlestar Groups to hunt down and destroy a single Cratus Basestar and even then, the odds of success were questionable as the Cratus was rarely alone on the battlefields.",,,
bsg_gorgon,SHIP,The Gorgon-class was a class of warship used by the Cylons during the Cylon War. It's a mostly defenseless Carrier meant to bring in some extra Fighters.,,,
bsg_nemesis,SHIP,"Nemesis tech corvettes are the spearhead of the Cylon electronic warfare strategy. Coupled with long-range missile capabilities and high maneuverability, these light ships are perfect for hit-and-run tactics that can hamstring larger capitals.",,,
bsg_phobos,SHIP,"The Phobos class tech cruiser has highly sophisticated DRADIS systems integrated into its FTL drives, allowing it to make tactical-range jumps while engaged with the enemy. An array of missile tubes, a fore-facing hangar and a powerful electronic warfare suite rounds out this high impact cruiser.",,,

bsg_colonies,FACTION,"The Twelve Colonies of Kobol, once settled in the Cyrannus system and invaded by the Cylons a small rag tag fleet of survivors set out to search for a new home a mythical planet called earth. The planet was located by a Raptor that was originally part of a SAR mission to Caprica but accidentally jumped to the wrong coordinates and landed in the sector, finding the new Helios Alpha system with a few habitable planets. After a harsh presidential election and many debates The new President Gaius Batlar decided to set foot on those planets and colonize the system completly. After a few months of governing Gaius Baltar resigned after heavy protests caused by mismanagement and a new government was elected. Similar in belief the Colonies quickly found an ally in the Hegemony and an enemy in Tri-Tachion. Their nemesis the Cylons quickly followed them and set foot in the nearby Zanus system but the Colonies knew how to defend themselves this time and the conflict is in a stalemate since then.",,,
bsg_cylons,FACTION,"After seemingly loosing the track of the survivor fleet of the Twelve Colonies of Kobol the Cylons were eventually able to track signatures of a Colonial fuel tanker, finding themselves right at the front door of the Helios Alpha system but quickly being blown away by Colonial artillery as the Colonies had quiet the time bonus because the Cylons took too long. After some fierce military engagements the Cylons where able to create a bridge head in the Zanus system, fully utilizing the resource rich system and starting production of a huge war machine in the sector, even trying to ally with the Colonies rivaling factions in the sector and starting to repurpose some of their older ships to be civilian ships. The Cylons use of AI is making it hard for them to be even remotley diplomatic, ending up to be almost as hated as the pirates and even more fanatic than the Luddic Path.",,,
