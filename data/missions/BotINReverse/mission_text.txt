Location: The Lagoon Nebula, NGC 6523
Date: Approx. 3 years after the Fall of the Twelve Colonies

The Battle of the Ionian Nebula occurs soon after the fleet of surviving Colonial ships jumps into the Ionian Nebula. Upon arriving at the nebula, the ships of the Fleet mysteriously lose all power. As the ships drift aimlessly, four Cylon basestars that had been tracking them jump into the nebula and begin launching Raiders. By the time power is restored to Galactica and the civilian ships, Raiders are already inbound and the Fleet is incapable of jumping to safety before they close to firing distance.
Defend all civilian ships and retreat!
